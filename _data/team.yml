  - name: Martin Odersky
    position: EPFL
    about: |

      Martin Odersky is a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. He is best known as the creator of the Scala programming language. Prior to that, he made several contributions to the development of Java. He created the Pizza and GJ languages, designed the original version of generics for Java, and wrote the javac reference compiler.

      More generally, Martin is interested in programming languages and methods, in particular how object-oriented and functional programming can be made to work seamlessly together. He believes is that the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin and should be unified as much as possible. He was named an ACM fellow for his achievements in this area.

  - name: Nicolas Rinaudo
    position: J.P. Morgan
    about: |

      Nicolas writes code for JPMorgan, where we use Scala to make some very complicated things seem very simple.

      After too many years as a Java programmer and a thankfully brief stint in marketing, Nicolas discovered Functional Programming through Scala and fell in love. Since then, he's made it his mission to learn and explain the scary bits, by focusing on practical applications.

      Nicolas is also the author and sole maintainer of a few useful OSS libraries, such as [kantan.csv](https://nrinaudo.github.io/kantan.csv/).
