        I am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, where I code mainly using Scala and other interesting technologies.
        I am involved in open-source projects, such as sttp, tapir, Quicklens, ElasticMQ and others.
        I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as JavaOne, LambdaConf, Devoxx and ScalaDays.

        Apart from writing closed- and open-source software, in my free time I try to read the Internet on
        various (functional) programming-related subjects.

      I had the incredible opportunity to complete my master's thesis at EPFL under the guidance of Martin Odersky.
      This collaboration led to the development of Tyqu, a type-safe database access Scala library.

      In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also gained valuable experience as a backend web developer at manGoweb,
      and I have worked on a distributed graph processing system at Oracle Labs.

      Martin Odersky is a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. He is best known as the creator of the Scala programming language. Prior to that, he made several contributions to the development of Java. He created the Pizza and GJ languages, designed the original version of generics for Java, and wrote the javac reference compiler.

      More generally, Martin is interested in programming languages and methods, in particular how object-oriented and functional programming can be made to work seamlessly together. He believes is that the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin and should be unified as much as possible. He was named an ACM fellow for his achievements in this area.

      I completed a BSc in Computer Science at the Uni of Hertfordshire in 2020 with first class honours and
      prior to this have a background in the music industry as a signed recording artist, record producer and
      audio engineer with credits including number 1 chart positions and platinum and gold sales.

      My final university dissertation project was a data mining driven hit song prediction application which,
      after years as a musician, I undertook to ultimately prove that music is magical and you can't predict a hit song.
      The data collected however suggested differently and the final application was able to successfully classify
      some hit songs with a classification rate of 65% using a model trained on 80 one-hit wonders and their 80
      accompanying follow-up commercial disappointments. I'm happy to discuss this at length anytime.

      After a failed bid at rock stardom Trevor eventually found a way to get paid for writing software with Macromedia Flash. After twenty years and dabbling with Python, Ruby, Objective-C and C# he now works almost exclusively on the JVM.

    about: |
      I'm a Scala Compiler Engineer at VirtusLab with more than 6 years of experience in Scala.
      In my team, I'm mostly specializing in Scala Native - an ahead-of-time compiler and native
      runtime for Scala. I'm also the main maintainer of that project.
      
      My biggest achievement was recently adding multithreading support to this support. For the last 3 years,
      I was mainly involved in multiple OSS initiatives, after a few years of being involved in commercial projects.
