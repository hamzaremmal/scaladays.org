### Description

Attendees will develop a streaming and scalable system from scratch. The workshop will cover the modeling and development of a streaming application using Scala 3 and technologies like fs2, Kafka, and ScalaJS. 

Attendees will build a multiplayer web game with ScalaJS, capable of reacting to real-time Kafka events.

The objectives for those attending this workshop should be:
- Gain experience in managing data streams
- Learn basic concepts of event-sourcing
- Deepen knowledge about functional domain modeling with the tools that Scala 3 offers
- Learn the basics of using asynchronous message systems.
- Understand how ScalaJS works and how to integrate 3rd party JS libraries.
- Build end-to-end reactive systems through hands-on experience.
- Have fun!

- Introduction talk
- Requirements document to build the system
- Continuing support to answer questions and solve potential blocks.
- Day 1 recap talk
